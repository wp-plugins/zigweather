== Description ==

ZigWeather adds a sidebar widget to show your current weather. Inspired by 'Weather Widget' by James Wilson, now completely rewritten using OOP techniques, with a simpler control panel and many features under development that are not offered by 'Weather Widget'. Weather data is provided by the weather.com XOAP feed.
